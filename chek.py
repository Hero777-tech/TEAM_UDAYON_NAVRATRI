    Converts black pixels in an image to transparent.

    This function opens an image, iterates through each pixel, and if a pixel's
    RGB values are all below a certain threshold, it makes that pixel transparent.

    Args:
        input_image_path (str): The file path for the source image.
        output_image_path (str): The file path to save the new image with a
                                 transparent background. Must be a .png file.
        threshold (int): A tolerance value (0-255). Pixels where the red, green,
                         and blue values are ALL below this number will be
                         made transparent. A lower value targets darker blacks.
